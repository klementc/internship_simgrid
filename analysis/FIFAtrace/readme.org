Timestamps found in tsFIFAClean should be the same as the ones used in the paper
"Efficient Provisioning of Bursty Scientific Workloads on the Cloud Using
Adaptive Elasticity Control".

In this paper the authors use the logs between: "21:21:12 on 25 June, 1998 to
22:44:31 on the same day". This corresponds to timestamps in seconds between
76881 and 81871.

To get them, I used the tools at [[https://github.com/klementc/WorldCup98][this repository]]Â to download the dataset. Data
files used are wc_day61_7.gz wc_day62_1.gz which contains dates including the
range we are interested in. We extract them using the modified recreate.c file
to obtain timestamps in seconds instead of the full log and parse it using the
process.awk file to fetch only timestamps that are within the interval.
