* Introduction
  Propose ways to formulate, on the user's side of SimGrid, elastic tasks (tasks
  with fluctuating usage/size).

* Findings

** Week 1 <2016-05-17 Tue>--<2016-05-20 Fri>
*** Things Done
- Read Introduction, Background and Architecture parts of the CloudSim's paper
  [[CS_p]]. Gave better understanding of cloud's layers and the difficulties
  added to grids.
- Opened the [[http://www.buyya.com/papers/gridsim.pdf][GridSim paper]], looked at some figures and closed it upon
  encountering pages of uml class diagram and code samples.
- Meet-up with Anne-Cécile and Martin. Better understanding of my role (how to
  express elastic tasks) and the context (other simulators, the point of this
  work, ...).
- Tweaked/Fixed vim/tmux/orgmode config stuff, [[https://github.com/sbihel/dotfiles][my dotfiles]].
- Looked resources on DCsim <<DCs>>. Said in 2012 that CloudSim is missing VM
  replication, VM dependences, work conserving cpu... Talks about reallocating
  resources to VM (not wasting cpu's unused shares/resources) and managing
  resources following fluctuating usage in general, but not elastic tasks. In
  the few examples, there is one about StaticPeak as a SimulationTask but all
  examples look the same, I must have missed something.
*** Blocking Points
- +Can't connect on irc through Inria's network ??+ Currently using a ssh
  tunnel.
- "lua5.2 found when lua5.3 is required" for -Denable_lua. Library for 5.3 not
  installed. /on OS X/
- libdw not found for -Denable_model-checking. /on OS X/
- +Should I focus on VM deployment (allocation, provisioning) or VM usage
  (management) ? ("les charges")+ VM usage. -> User is using the simulator to
  test it's allocator of VMs.
*** Planned Work
- [X] Install SimGrid from source
- [X] Autoconnect #simgrid on irc.oftc.net
- [X] Read tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/documentation.php]]
- [X] Go through tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.13/doc/tutorial.html]]
- [X] See concurrent tools like DCsim and GridSim. Pay attention to VM charges.
